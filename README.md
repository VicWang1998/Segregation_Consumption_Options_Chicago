### Coursera Capstone Project: Segregation and Consumption Options in Chicago
This is a repository for the IBM coursera course capstone project. For this project, I chose to inspect differences about venue types among the 77 Chicago community areas, and try to relate such divergence to the racial and economic segregation prevailing the city. 

Codes for the project are stored in a Jupyter Notebook file named "Segregation and Shopping Options in Chicago"; 
full report is stored in the PDF file named "Coursera Captone Report". 

8.21 Update: 
Notebook and report finalized and uploaded.
